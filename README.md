1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-analyzer.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd log-analyzer`
4. Run the script with your log file replacing `path/to/your/log/file.txt`: `python analyze_logs.py path/to/your/log/file.txt`

## Configuration Example

You can customize the regex patterns in the `analyze_logs.py` script according to your specific needs.
